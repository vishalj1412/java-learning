Stream->it is sequence of element.
* it is pipeline of methods.
*there are two types of methods.
1)intermidiate methods->
* range(1,11) method used for define range from 1 to 10.
eg= IntStream.range(1,11).forEach(x->System.out.println(x));
hear IntStream is pridefined class.
*limit(10) it assing limit.
*Stream.of(10,5,4,6,12,34).filter(x->x>20)
* .filter(x-> x.contains("j");  //it filter string and gate result which contains j
*   .map(String::toUppercase);  //it convert string into uppercase which is filtered
*  .forEach(y-> Systeam.out.println(y))  //it is terminal method which is print each result.
* Stream.genrate(Math::random).limit(5).forEach(System.out::println)  //it prints 5 random numbers.

*Stream.of(10,5,4,6,12,34).filter(x->x>20).count();    it give count of result.

2)Terminal methods->
*forEach()
*count()
